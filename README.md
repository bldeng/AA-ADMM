##Anderson Acceleration for ADMM

Please checkout the README file in each folder for instructions on usage.


The folders contain the following code:

* 'admm\_anderson\_hard\_zxu' and 'admm\_anderson\_xzu'
	* accelerated solver for physics simulation, based on the implementation of [Overby et al. 2017] available at: https://github.com/mattoverby/admm-elastic.

* 'Geometry'
	* accelerated ADMM for wire mesh optimization and planar quad mesh optimization, based on the formulation of [Deng et al. 2015].
